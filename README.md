Fresh, nightly builds of winget.

Want to see what the latest cool feature is on the [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) master branch? This repository compiles a daily build for you to use.

To use it, download the [latest](https://github.com/jedieaston/winget-build/releases/latest) copy of wingetdev.zip, extract it, and run `wingetdev.exe`! Note that all of the files in that folder have to stay together, so if you have a .bin folder you like to put loose executables in, keep them together.

No dependencies should be necessary outside of the Desktop Bridge VCLibs, which you already have if winget is installed on your system.
